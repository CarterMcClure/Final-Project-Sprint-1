As a user, I want for my login to be remembered, logging me in automatically along with a welcome back message mentioning my username.
As a client I would like the app to have the games designed with a clear separation so deleting or removing games is easier.
As a client I would like the protocols and interfaces utilitized to be standard, so it is easier to use with third-party tools.
As a client I would like you to use a version control system so that developers collaborate and can rollback changes.
As a client I would like you to plan for a database to be utilized by creating a database with fake information now for testing so that I know it is on standby.
As a client I would like for the GUI code to not have any business logic or game logic included in it so it could be used for the mobile market.
As a user, I would like to be able to customize the overall “wallpapering” of my view of the app.
As a client I would like a way to display ads via stub, and a way to change duration of ads via admin login. I would like the admin login to use the name Soggie Muffins and the password to be 123
